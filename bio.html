  <h3>About Me</h3>
 <div class="bio"> 
  <p class="about">Hello! My name is Erica, and I'm a journalism major here at Eastern Washington University, graduating in December 2018. My hobbies include traveling, horseback riding, cosplaying, gaming, and photography. I've been riding competitively in Dressage since 2007. My travels have taken me through 21 different countries across the world. I've been competitively costuming since 2011, traveling across the country for conventions and dedicating hundreds of hours into each costume.</p>
